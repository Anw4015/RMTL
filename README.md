Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is an active research field in machine learning. It is a learning paradigm which aims to jointly learn several related tasks to improve their generalization performance by leveraging common knowledge among them. In recent years, many researchers have successfully applied MTL to different fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, recommendation system and so on.

The recent studies of MTL mainly focus on two perspectives, network architecture design and loss weighting. We implement some general and representative methods in LibMTL.

Install LibMTL: git clone https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL.git (https://libmtl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting_started/installation.html)

Model 1 is built with reference to "An Tutorial for Regularized Multi-task Learning using the package RMTL"（https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMTL/vignettes/rmtl.html）
